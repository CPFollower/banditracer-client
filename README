Quick start
============

 * create `javascript/settings.js`, use `javascript/settings-example.js' as template.
 * open `index.html` with firefox/safari
     (serve over http:// to enable all browsers)

Deploy client
==============

To improve the loading behaviour, pack all Js files into one and only load that one. see gamejs/docs/deployment for more info.



Server
========

Recommended directory layout for checking out both banditracer and the gamejs
repo:

    ~/br/
    ~/br/banditracer-client/
    ~/br/banditracer-server/
    ~/br/gamejs/

For the server, you need http://RingoJs.org

ringo ~/br/banditracer-server/ringomain.js
